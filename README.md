# Coastal for iOS

## Dependencies

Using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), in the root of the project, run:

```
pod install
```

Be sure to use the same version of CocoaPods that was used to generate `Podfile.lock`. One way to do that is through [podenv](https://github.com/kylef-archive/podenv).
